<p>Notes - Hello Jeff,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We currently use Procore as our construction mgt software and have used Insightly in the past, but to limited results.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re considering salesforce simply because I used in the past.&nbsp; Do you have a demo package or software download to evaluate?&nbsp; Or maybe a quick demo at our office?</p>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>My team is interested in learning more about Cosential.&nbsp; We have attended a few of the free webinars about the product over the last month.&nbsp; We are particularly interested in learning more about the implementation services and the cost of implementation.&nbsp; We are looking to move forward quickly as we have already looked into other CRM programs and feel this one best suits our needs.&nbsp; Please let me know when someone is available.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I thought it might be helpful to outline where we are with Deltek and some challenges, for our meeting on Thursday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CRM &ndash; Current State</p>

<p>Today, we use Deltek&rsquo;s Vision database and product as the foundation of our CRM architecture.&nbsp; Our Business Development process is designed around an account management framework.&nbsp; In construction, the real, total lifecycle of any given pursuit can last 5 years.&nbsp; We are often aware of opportunities 2 years prior to their going to market for bid.&nbsp; Some bid processes can run up to 1 year.&nbsp; Finally, project delivery can last from 1-4 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, our CRM tool has evolved to help manage the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Account/Customer management</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuit/Opportunity tracking/management &nbsp;(leads)</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forecasting (3 year sales outlook)</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuit Management (4 phases, proposals, team assignments)</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partial Talent Database</p>

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data base linking each employee to prior projects, skill sets, qualifications</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Award Management (job creation)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, the system is mostly available as an online data base.&nbsp; We have implemented their mobile application.&nbsp; Report writing and analysis often has to be completed using other 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;party tools.&nbsp; We have about 120 total users broken down as follows:&nbsp; 40 account managers, 12 marketing specialists, 30 profit center level users, 40 administrative users including accounting, compliance/legal, HR, and others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CRM &ndash; Desired Future State</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are currently in the process of reviewing the Deltek product to make a decision on either staying with the product or migrating to a different platform.&nbsp; Below are the issues driving this review:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for better data analytics</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for stronger report writing and dashboard capabilities</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for simpler data interface and user input, including mobile capabilities</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability for 1 CRM product to manage all of the current state functions</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to integrate data across systems (CRM, Accounting (J.D. Edwards) and Industry Specific Project Management Software (Prolog)</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best value solution &ndash; capability x cost</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our current system does some of these well, and others not so well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
