<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I thought it might be helpful to outline where we are with Deltek and some challenges, for our meeting on Thursday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CRM &ndash; Current State</p>

<p>Today, we use Deltek&rsquo;s Vision database and product as the foundation of our CRM architecture.&nbsp; Our Business Development process is designed around an account management framework.&nbsp; In construction, the real, total lifecycle of any given pursuit can last 5 years.&nbsp; We are often aware of opportunities 2 years prior to their going to market for bid.&nbsp; Some bid processes can run up to 1 year.&nbsp; Finally, project delivery can last from 1-4 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, our CRM tool has evolved to help manage the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Account/Customer management</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuit/Opportunity tracking/management &nbsp;(leads)</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forecasting (3 year sales outlook)</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuit Management (4 phases, proposals, team assignments)</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partial Talent Database</p>

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data base linking each employee to prior projects, skill sets, qualifications</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Award Management (job creation)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, the system is mostly available as an online data base.&nbsp; We have implemented their mobile application.&nbsp; Report writing and analysis often has to be completed using other 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;party tools.&nbsp; We have about 120 total users broken down as follows:&nbsp; 40 account managers, 12 marketing specialists, 30 profit center level users, 40 administrative users including accounting, compliance/legal, HR, and others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CRM &ndash; Desired Future State</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are currently in the process of reviewing the Deltek product to make a decision on either staying with the product or migrating to a different platform.&nbsp; Below are the issues driving this review:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for better data analytics</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for stronger report writing and dashboard capabilities</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for simpler data interface and user input, including mobile capabilities</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability for 1 CRM product to manage all of the current state functions</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to integrate data across systems (CRM, Accounting (J.D. Edwards) and Industry Specific Project Management Software (Prolog)</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best value solution &ndash; capability x cost</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our current system does some of these well, and others not so well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>2/24 - tt Zach. &nbsp;Just moved offices, has not been focused on CRM. &nbsp;Still very early in looking at what is out there.Thinks he probably needs to try using Act a bit (which apparently they have) to get a sense of how a CRM could fit his workflow, then start to explore options. &nbsp;I encouraged him to attend the webinar next week. &nbsp;Closing lead - he isn&#39;t moving on anything any time soon.1/19 - emailed webinar links, encouraged him to attend proposal automation on wednesday&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1/15- lvm &amp; emailed Zach, we touche base this afternoon. &nbsp;Very eary stages of looking for CRM - probably not a fit at this point, but maybe - Zach is the only guy toing BD &amp; marketing. &nbsp;REcognized he&#39;ll need to get more sophisticated at some point, but not looking to pull trigger anytime soon - this is more exploring options and pricing. &nbsp;Encouraged him to attend public webinars, let me know if that looks appealing enough to evaluate in depth. &nbsp;<br />

Managing partner goes through that to determine macklog. &nbsp;Also helpful: &nbsp;photo storage (create slide shows for recruiting events), mailing lists, see references. &nbsp;Pain points: &nbsp;things get lost, unable to find info they need in a timely fashion, no formal processes. &nbsp;Demo next week: &nbsp;start w/ CRM overview/terminology. &nbsp;Realistically, they would probably want to roll something out in late summer or fall, but TBD. &nbsp;<br />

<p>I had a Cosential sales representative provide a demo of the software several years ago. I am interested in seeing if I can get a demo scheduled for next week so that our other company partners can see what the software can do. We have a partners meeting and ideally I&rsquo;d like to have a demo at some point during our meeting. Is there anyone available to provide us an online demo of the software next Tuesday, March 10<sup>th</sup>? Please let me know as soon as possible.</p>

Scheduling demo with Kristen, BD person, and other marketing person. &nbsp;If that goes well, we&#39;ll demo for firm leadership. &nbsp;Likely to implement Q4.

<p>Hi Jennifer,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reaching out. We were in the midst of an office move for the first half of the year, so had to postpone big-ticket conversations. I saw your booth at the SMPS Pacific Regional Conference in Huntington Beach earlier this year, but when I was able to get over to talk to them on the last day, they weren&rsquo;t at the booth, but it worked out fine, as we had to delay any major purchase conversations until after the office move.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are now looking ahead to 2015 to get some numbers together, and would love to earmark some dollars for a database rollout in 2015. Not sure if you are the correct person to talk to, and if not, please let me know who I should be speaking to. We have been in need of finding a more comprehensive system, one that talks to Outlook (and possibly our other databases), and covers our major needs: CRM, lead tracking, and project database. We are not interested in proposal generator software, so I&rsquo;m guessing that Cosential would be more in line with what we are seeking as opposed to Axium, but will defer to you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It would be great to have an initial conversation regarding our needs, and then to be able to see a demo of the software, and get a cost estimate of course.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let me know your timing and what additional info you would need from me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Todd</p>

Replied suggesting we connect when they've talked; perhaps new conference leads would be a good opportunity to look at how Cosential could streamline processes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>7/07 - Reviewed Cosential w/ Chad, talked through typical CRM evaluation criteria (he's new to CRM evaluation). &nbsp;He likes our system, but would not use all of its features. &nbsp;Talked through pricing - we're offering CRM only licenses. &nbsp;He is not certain that the value of Cosential is $1500+ more than Tracker RMS... or at least not certain the best way to sell that to his boss. &nbsp;My thoughts on that: &nbsp;1) Superior Implementation, best practices, ""teach a man to fish"" (we talked about that); 2) More features (tracking subs, prequals, task assignment, integration of lead sources/web forms - we talked about that); 3) Marketing Functions for the Marketing Department (have not discussed); 4) reporting capabilities for Firm Principal (discussed a little bit on first demo, didn't get into today). &nbsp;Jed and Chad to reconvene Wednesday to discuss how best to present this to his boss.<br><p>7/03 - Chad reports that he has eliminated Salesforce and Sugar from contention, will decide between Cosential and Tracker. &nbsp;Scheduled call for 11 am CDT on Monday to discuss next steps. &nbsp;Would like to make a decision by July 11th. &nbsp;Would still need to get principal to sign off, July deal if we're his choice.</p><p>7/02 - demo w/ Chad, went well. &nbsp;Didn't show projects or proposal automation- those aren't important. &nbsp;He liked the ability to create/assign tasks, even to those who aren't Cosential end users. &nbsp;Liked lead management, ability to integrate with web service. &nbsp;Email to ""...@cosential.com"" for creating leads through his webform is probably easiest path to get webform leads in place. &nbsp;Bottom line: &nbsp;He likes Cosential. &nbsp;Price ($4200+) too high compared to Tracker RMS (approx. $444/year for one person) - he will not feel confident taking that to firm principal when Tracker gives most of what he is looking for (simplicity, essential functions for tracking/contacts, seemingly&nbsp;good support/implementation).&nbsp; If we can get more competitive on price, we'll discuss further. &nbsp;Talked it over with Matt, emailed him offer for $2435 first-year cost (up to 3 CRM-only users, 4 hrs implementation, 3 hrs training... didn't break out the detail, just $2435 first year, $1080 subsequent years). &nbsp;If that makes us competitive, let's tag up to discuss pricing detail and next steps. &nbsp;(NOTE: &nbsp;other systems are letting him ""kick the tires"" in Sandbox instances, he would have preferred if we could do that, but understands that it isn't an option).</p><table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" style=""width:100.0%;"" width=""100%"">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td colspan=""2"">			<p>7/01&nbsp;- intro call, went well - wants a decision quickly. &nbsp;Price will become an issue, more than likely, but right fit more important than dollars. &nbsp;Demo tomorrow at 10:30 am CDT</p>			<p><strong>Contact Information</strong></p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>Company name:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p>Daniels and Daniels Construction</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>Contact name:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p>Chad Vanderipe</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>Job title:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p>Business Development Manager</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>Office:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p>(918) 779-0653</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>Email:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p><a href=""mailto:cvanderipe@churchesbydaniels.com"">cvanderipe@churchesbydaniels.com</a></p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>Website:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p><a href=""http://www.danddcc.com/"">http://www.danddcc.com/</a></p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>Address:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p>3501 West Kenosha Street</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>City:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p>Broken Arrow</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>State:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p>OK</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>ZIP code:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p>74012</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>Country:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p>United States</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>Timestamp:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p>6/27/14 09:23 CDT</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td colspan=""2"">			<p>&nbsp;</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td colspan=""2"">			<p><strong>Company Profile</strong></p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style=""width:150px;"">			<p>Segment:</p>			</td>			<td>			<p>Construction - B2B.

<br />
7/10 - she sent Chris Chivetta&#39;s redlines, we&#39;re reviewing this afternoon. &nbsp;Talked through them with Grace - we should be in good shape on everything, she didn&#39;t seem put out that we&#39;re unwilling to modify our limitation of liability. &nbsp;On the Prof. Svcs. Exhibit, she can send me a paragraph/clause/redline that gets them comfortable with it and we&#39;ll be good (per Dan). &nbsp;She said she&#39;ll send that today, she&#39;d like me to revamp the contract to reflect redlines, she&#39;ll send to Chris to sign. &nbsp;He is out of office until mid-next week, but she thinks she can talk with him this weekend and get him to execute via e-signature - &nbsp;they&#39;re eager to get started, have already hired an intern or two to do some data entry. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
7/09 - Grace was out last week, lvm today. &nbsp;Grace LVM for me later in the day - they are waiting for Chris Chivetta to sign the agreement; he has been in and out of the office for the last week+, working to get his attention.</p>

<p>6/27 - Carrie called - Michelle and Grace are both out, so she has done reference calls. &nbsp;Answered questions on implementation timeline, initial Cosential commitment (it is one year - no outs). &nbsp;She asked for contract for 3 full, 2 read-only, including Deltek Vision FDC. &nbsp;Christopher Chivetta is authorized signer. &nbsp;She will push for a signature in the next day or two, but chances are remote to pull it into June. &nbsp;Likely July close.</p>

<p>6/19- &nbsp;Sent reference intro email to Mike Conner of Bohlin Cynwinski Jackson (who reports that his firm is partnering w/ Hastings + Chivetta on a project at Wash U. in St. Louis). &nbsp;Also talked to Denise Sweeden, got green light, sent reference intro email to her and Michelle/Grace as well. &nbsp;Have green light from Kathy Kalt of DAG Architects - she&#39;s a HUGE fan of Cosential, but only uses for proposal automation... may intro&nbsp;Kathy in a few days w/ the caveat that she is just proposal person, but may give them some perspective on how to incorporate that down the road. &nbsp;</p>

<p>6/18 - tt Michelle - Keeping Deltek is 95% off the table - they are planning to choose between AEC360 and Cosential. &nbsp;AEC360 has no proposal automation, right? That is no longer the top priority for them - biz dev/lead/pipeline mgmt more important, although she thinks Cosential&#39;s proposal automation is great and they would likely use it eventually - but that&#39;s secondary concern. &nbsp;Getting references over to her, the firm principal still wants recommendation before EOM. &nbsp;Michelle out much of next week, Grace Nordmann may be the one making calls to references, intro both of them in emails. &nbsp;</p>

<p>6/17 - Traded emails with Michelle - she requested pricing breakdown and references. &nbsp;Wasn&#39;t able to reach her by phone, but emailed detailed pricing breakdown (implementation: &nbsp;$5610, including the $2500 Deltek FDC). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
6/12- Demo w/ Michelle Gray, Tarah Smith, Grace Nordman, and Carrie (all in marketing), plus Dale Harvey (Business Development). Went well - new mobile w/ geographic search was well-received (in screenshot form). &nbsp;Key things: &nbsp;better tracking of opportunities/leads/clients, streamline processes. &nbsp;They will discuss, we&#39;ll reconnect early next week to talk next steps. &nbsp;Gave pricing overview in broad strokes.</p>

<p>6/11 - talked w/ Michelle, Qualfied Lead. &nbsp;They use Deltek Vision for accounting, have CRM module but find it not user-friendly, and have regressed to using Excel to track leads/pursuits. &nbsp;50 person firm. Use Outlook. &nbsp;MOBILE is critical for them - want to hear about that. &nbsp;4 people in Marekting department, one BD Director. &nbsp;Those 5 will be on demo tomorrow, their boss has requested a CRM recommendation by July 1st. &nbsp;3 options - stick w/ Deltek, invest in Cosential, invest in AEC 360. &nbsp;Proposal automation important. &nbsp;Respond to about 100 RFPs per year, which accounts for half their business, the other half from existing relationships. &nbsp;The boss - ultimate DM - will not join us for demo, unable to get him involved. &nbsp;No firm implementation timeline. &nbsp;Budget TBD. &nbsp;Scheduled 1:30 pm demo on Thursday, 6/12.</p>

7/10 - lvm Katie - let&#39;s talk next steps.</p>

<p>7/02 - looks like we didn&#39;t have any US2 folks attend the webinar, although Katie registered. &nbsp;LVM for her - if they weren&#39;t able to make it, can we schedule an alternative?</p>

<p>6/20- demo with Katie, Matthew, Charlie Pickett (sales), Larry Ward (sales), and Simone Sanders (proposals, database?). &nbsp;Went very well - efficiency aspects appealing, integrations, minimizing typing/data entry, mobile application. &nbsp;Simone had lots of technical questions - integration with a lead service that I wasn&#39;t familiar with (not FedBizOps, might have been FedBid?), we don&#39;t have an integration, but they can import via spreadsheet. &nbsp;Sent Simone FDC installation guide. &nbsp;Larry (or Charlie?) asked about &quot;dragon naturally speaking&quot; dictation-to-text software, they&#39;d love to have some kind of integration like that someday. &nbsp;Jed to connect with Katie in next couple of days for feedback and next steps. &nbsp;We didn&#39;t get much past the Opportunity level in the demo (lots of focus on grid views/tasks/integrations), may want some time to show Proposal Automation, although that functionality is secondary to them. &nbsp;Follow-up questions for me to track down answers: &nbsp; 1) can we sync from Cosential to a &quot;group&quot; calendar in Outlook? [also - jed to get detail on calendar sync in general... is that only for &#39;events&#39;? &nbsp;not sure]; &nbsp;2) Can tasks be created/assigned through the mobile application?; &nbsp;3) &nbsp;Is our iOS application &quot;universal&quot; (optimized for both iphone and ipad), or not (meaning it was built specifically for one or the other, and runs in some kind of &quot;compatibility mode&quot; in the other?). &nbsp;</p>

<p>Talked w/ Katie after demo, answered a question from CFO (yes, he would need a Cosential login to view sales projections in Cosential... either Full license if he wants to manipulate things in Goals module, or Read-Only if he just wants a quick look at pipeline). &nbsp;Katie thinks that Cosential is the ideal fit for the firm. &nbsp;In order to get a signature, she is certain SOMEONE from our firm (me, maybe Reid if he is in town?) will need to meet CEO &amp; President David Shutler (Dave) in-person in Dallas. &nbsp;Talked details of implementation and timing. &nbsp;Timing would be perfect for them for a July signature - Katie will be OFA, she has free time through SEptember. &nbsp;Sales is super-busy through September (aligning to Federal Gov&#39;t&#39;s fiscal year end 9/30), but will have time to train after October 1. &nbsp;Late July signature, maybe early August, and 12 weeks implementation will be great. &nbsp;Will likely need to talk with Ops department - I think they are the folks who do a lot of entry/maintenance on business they&#39;ve won. &nbsp;Next step: &nbsp;Dave and folks from Ops to attend July 3rd CRM webinar (Dave is OOO until June 30th, couldn&#39;t do anything until then anyway), that will prompt questions and deeper dive. &nbsp;Sent registration link. &nbsp;Dave was originally scheduled to be on call today but had a flight and couldn&#39;t make it.</p>

<p>6/10 - exploratory call with Matthew and Katie Troy. &nbsp;Need their systems to talk to one another - systems w/ project info, lead info, etc. &nbsp;Want to tie proposals/projects/experience together, give everyone access to things quickly. &nbsp;(Go/No-Go not important). &nbsp;Katie needs to do reporting, as well. &nbsp;HAve homegrown filemaker system for key sales &amp; operations contacts). &nbsp;Using Sage 300 for accounting. &nbsp;Do mostly work w/ VA Hospitals (regional divisions around the country), they get to know the energy managers @ those places, cultivate relationships, get more work. &nbsp;Respond to some RFPs, but as few as possible. &nbsp;Have a consulting firm they work with who filters through the federal gov&#39;t stuff and feeds them the things that fit... they are a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, so they are able to get a lot of work through that status. &nbsp;Do lots of SF330s, especially for Army. &nbsp;On proposals, seems like they are pulling pages from Word/PPT and putting into PDFs. &nbsp;Simone, new bid writer, is handling some proposal stuff. &nbsp;Sales team is on the road, need something easy to update. &nbsp;23-ish people in-office, they may want 10 or so seats. &nbsp;Talked pricing, implementation, qualfied on price. &nbsp;Sales team has a &quot;wish list&quot;, we&#39;ll need to get their buy-in. &nbsp;Next step: &nbsp;demo for firm owner,some members of sales team on Friday, 6/20. &nbsp;No specific timetable (although some people want it &quot;yesterday&quot;), but would want something implemented in 2014. &nbsp; Katie has used SFDC, they are looking into that as well, discussed differences - she understand that it would require some customization. &nbsp;Emailed w/ confirmation that we have integration for Sage 300, included FDC overview and WhyCosential.</p>

<br />
5/23 - Scheduled demo for 10 am CDT on Friday, 5/30.</p>

<p>5/22 - long convo w/ Celeste. &nbsp;Soundsl lie a great fit. &nbsp;Will need to get Sandra&#39;s buy-in, she&#39;ll have to approve budget. Celeste has heard good things about Cosential for years at SMPS events. Challenges w/ current systems: &nbsp;Filemaker DB is inflexible, requires duplicate entry, and they&#39;ve sunk a lot of money into trying to make it work better for them, unsucessfully. Contacts in Outlook and contacts in Filemaker don&#39;t sync. &nbsp;InDesign non-ideal as resume information storage place - requires extensive data entry, time. Celeste doing analytics manually in Excel. &nbsp;Have no current formal Go/No-Go process, Celeste trying to implement one (5 questions) right now because they are spending too much time &quot;chasing rainbows&quot;. &nbsp;Celeste will email me about demo next week with her, Sandra, and Pamela. &nbsp;Will need to satisfy Pamela on tech issues (security/backup), integrations. &nbsp;Sandra: make compelling case... efficiency, information flow, transparency, and analytics/reporting/pipeline/forecasting. &nbsp;<span style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;"">Sub-contractor 98% of the time, often sub on competing bid teams going after same projects.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>5/21 - spoke briefly w/ Celeste, she was on her way out. &nbsp;We&#39;re going to do an exploratory call tomorrow for 10-15 minutes, then we&#39;ll schedule a demo that will include Celeste&#39;s manager (a she). &nbsp;Emailed her my contact info, please let me know a good time to chat tomorrow.</p>

<p>9/30 - Joe, CFO, has been out, and HE has not talked w/ our refs yet, he wants to do that before signing. &nbsp; Marisa to update me tomorrow.<br />
<br />
8/21 - called, no msg, keep trying today. &nbsp;Called again and got Marisa: &nbsp;Demo audience very impressed. &nbsp;One person said &quot;They&#39;ve thought of everything.&quot; &nbsp;Team is meeting on Tuesday w/ VP to determine # of seats, and hopefully make final decision to move forward - we should know on Tuesday. &nbsp;If not, may need one more convo w/ financial DMs. &nbsp;Call her Tuesday after 3:30. &nbsp;Let her know I&#39;ll be traveling W-F with limited availability, would like to get any paperwork lined up on Tuesday before I leave. &nbsp;Likely Sept. close, outside chance for quick turnaround on signature next week.<br />
<br />
8/20 - demo with Marisa &amp; Justin, Rhonda Bligh (Biz Dev), Joe Moore (CFO), Grant Hutton (Estimator), Belinda Lassiter (Exec. Asst. to President). &nbsp;Went well, Marisa found proposal components helpful. &nbsp;Talked pricing, implementation fee between $3100 and $6100, depending largely on Timberline integration. &nbsp;Confirmed that we can run Outlook with their Exchange 365, but they have had some firewall challenges with 365 and other applications - we always have Ethnos plug-in at desktop level, too. &nbsp;Jed to connect with Marisa this afternoon for group&#39;s feedback. &nbsp;<br />
Called a couple of times in the afternoon, LVM for Marisa - will try tomorrow.<br />
<br />
8/15 - tt Marisa, scheudled demo next week. &nbsp;Large group, now ready to move things forward.<br />
<br />
5/28 - Marisa emailed me asking if she could view the webinar Justin watched (proposal? not sure), or if we&#39;re having another one soon. &nbsp;I volunteered to demo for her - asked about scheduling.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>5/22- Justin and Marisa both attended 5/21 webinar. &nbsp;TT Marisa - proposal automation would be great for her role. &nbsp;They&#39;ve discussed internally, and they are ready to do a serious evaluation. &nbsp;Marisa on board with getting ultimate DMs on board early (VP And CFO) for at least an exploratory/intro/agenda-setting call. &nbsp;They need to determine who will be on evaluation team; likely won&#39;t know all personnel involved for a week or two - a couple of folks are out of office. &nbsp;She and Justin will let me know. &nbsp;Emailed Justin to respond to the question he asked on demo yesterday, cc&#39;d Marisa. &nbsp;</p>

<p>5/13 - talked with Marisa (pr: muh-REE-suh) after she requested demo thru our website. She was not aware that I&#39;d spoken with Justin. &nbsp;Apparently their VP is the one who asked the ACI team to look into Cosential. &nbsp;Marisa is Marketing Coordinator, very interested in proposals piece, also CRM. &nbsp;She would likely manage a large part of Cosential if they were to buy. &nbsp;I suggested she check out public demo for proposals on 5/21, then we can discuss Cosential in-depth with all of the key players when the CFO is back next week. &nbsp;Other people involved in eval: &nbsp;VP, Assistant to VP, maybe a few other end users. &nbsp;Sent webinar registration link to both Marisa and Justin, we&#39;ll talk next week.</p>

<p>5/09 - talked w/Justin. &nbsp;Liked public demo, they will want to take a more in-depth look, but we&#39;ll probably need to wait for a week or two&nbsp;- CFO will be involved, he is out of office all next week. &nbsp;I suggested including all DM&#39;s on intro call initially, even if they aren&#39;t oging to be participating in extensive demo &amp; Q&amp;A&#39;s. &nbsp;Discussed Office 365 - their email server is basically on the cloud (Exchange, but cloud, if I understand correctly). &nbsp;So we probably can&#39;t integrate at that level, but they all use Outlook on their desktops as email client - we can do the Ethnos integration there. &nbsp;Will probably be week of 5/19, at earliest, before I hear from them on scheduling.</p>

<p>5/07 - lvm and sent email proposing intro call.&nbsp;He called back and we chatted a bit before publc demo, which he was ready to attend. &nbsp;Firm is mainly construction management. &nbsp;Not really bidding, just negotiating and getting work. &nbsp;No CRM at the moment - spreadsheets and an admin who keeps trak of things. &nbsp;Interviewing and hiring a BD Mgr, will probalby wait until that hire before buing a CRM. &nbsp;Use Timberline. &nbsp;MS office. &nbsp;work with schools, develpers, oweners. &nbsp;Likely 5 or 6 end Cosential users, mostly do-er/sellers. &nbsp;There are a couple of folks who do proposals. &nbsp;can we integrate with Outlook 365, the cloud-based Outlook?</p>

Biz Dev manager they&#39;re bringing on will help open doors for them where they don&#39;t already have relationships, then PM will take over. &nbsp;CRM will be a biz dev platform, does not need to interact w/ project management. &nbsp;Want to track inventory in the marketplace. &nbsp;Track, for property manager, how many square feet do they have? &nbsp;How many sq. feet available? &nbsp;They can import some of that from &quot;costar databases&quot; on expiring leases. &nbsp;Focus exlusively on Phoenix metro market, only 25-30 clients are REALLY clients. &nbsp;Some are big, like CBRE or Jones Lange Lasalle. &nbsp;Want to create proposal template library. &nbsp;Demo on Wednesday. &nbsp;Will include TJ (Greg&#39;s partner) and Jackie (project coordinator). &nbsp;Also looking at BASE (?), SFDC, Zoho.<br />

<br />

<p><span style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;"">7/07 - Natalie is meeting with Jon Gilmore on Wednesday, 7/16. &nbsp;Needs to get him to sign off on spend - she anticipates no problems, expects to get this done. &nbsp;Challenge we&#39;ve had with this over the last month or two has really been limited bandwidth - Natalie is THE marketing department, got buried under proposals. &nbsp;Optimistic that we will get this done, but they haven&#39;t been good about sticking with firm dates.</span></p>

<p>6/20 - After 2-3 weeks of no responses, Natalie finalized seats and asked for contract - 3 full, 5 R-O, including Timberline integration. &nbsp;Sent agreement, asked for clarification on timing. &nbsp;Ready to sign now?</p>

<p>5/29 - lvm for natalie after several calls, no msgs- # seats?<br />
<br />
5/22 - finally connected with Natalie - they&#39;ve been incredibly busy (deadlines, a photo shoot, etc.), but everything calms down on Wednesday, 5/28. &nbsp;She wants to do this, just needs to get the green light from principal. &nbsp;Will be helpful to have a contract hand. &nbsp;Getting final seat count via email, will send contract. &nbsp;Still possible May close, but I think June is more likely. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
5/19 - continuing to lvm and email Natalie, not been able to connect &nbsp;- is this still on track for May?<br />
<br />
5/13- lvm Natalie- ready to discuss next steps?<br />
<br />

<br />
4/22 - Natalie is out of the office until April 28th. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
4/2 - demo w/ Natalie, went well. &nbsp;Wants time to digest, please find (if possible) some detail on Timberline sync. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
4/1 - Exploratory call with Natalie: &nbsp;using SFDC for contact database only. &nbsp;Needs: &nbsp;CRM, project archive, financial system integration. &nbsp;Firm principals recognize need, would like to make a decision on something by end of April. &nbsp;Project data currently housed piecemeal in excel spreadsheets, Timberline, and an Access database. &nbsp;Natalie is only dedicated marketing person, there is one dedicated BD guy. &nbsp;They have 4 SFDC licenses, Natalie and BD guy are the only ones to really use it. &nbsp;Talked pricing: &nbsp;minimum 3 seats, approx $5600 implementation w/ FDC. &nbsp;Natalie basically the one making decision. Heard about us through peers in the industry. &nbsp;Only negative she has heard is that our training is not as robust as it could be. &nbsp;Uses InDesign primarily for proposals. &nbsp;Demo tomorrow, 2 pm CDT.<br />
<br />
3/27 - spoke w/ Natalie, rescheduled our exploratory call for 9 am CDT on Tuesday, April 1.<br />
<br />
3/18- emailed re: reschedule.<br />

4/4 - tt Kelsey. &nbsp;Firm principals want to see, first-hand, how proposal automation works. &nbsp;They don&#39;t have any specific concerns, but they want to see it for themselves. &nbsp;(Hoping I can recruit Reid again for superior InDesign integration detail). &nbsp;She is going to get bullet-point list of stuff they want to see over to me on Monday. &nbsp;Trying for demo late next week... if we can get demo in place within a week or so, I think we&#39;ll still be on track for April close. &nbsp;We don&#39;t need to pipeline/contact management on this, it is just proposals, and possibly some detail on Timberline integration. &nbsp;Kelly may be able to send me some templates that we could use for examples.&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;</p>","<p>5/14- Valerie asked for contract June 2nd, they should be able to start then, just need to wait to get other stuff tackled first. &nbsp;Proposed putting anniversary date of August 1 if we can get signature in May, that should work. &nbsp;Sending her contract.<br />
<br />
5/06 - Valerie wants 4 full-access licenses, 9 read-only. &nbsp;Not sure if they&#39;re ready to sign just yet... they&#39;re finishing another project (implementation of software?) and probably don&#39;t want to sign until that is finished, maybe another week or two. &nbsp;I asked her to get some clarity on that before I send over agreement (since I need to include an expiration). &nbsp;(NOTE: &nbsp;if she comes back with a timeline that jeopardizes close this month, I&#39;ll offer adjusted anniversary date in exchange for signature in May).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5/02 - Demo with principals Gary Ferguson and Tom Forney, plus Valerie. &nbsp;Went well - Valerie emailed immediately afterward to let me know Tom wants to move forward. &nbsp;She and Gary will determine license counts within a week or so and we&#39;ll get them a contract.<br />
<br />
4/28 - Scheduled demo for 5/02 at 9 am CDT.<br />
<br />
4/25 - lvm Valerie, scheduling demo?<br />
<br />
4/22 - Valerie reports that Gary is on board, other principals hesitant, want one more demo. &nbsp;Working with her on scheduling.<br />
<br />
4/18- vm for Valerie - feedback? &nbsp;Moving forward?<br />
<br />
4/15 - emailed - how did it go this morning?<br />
<br />
4/14- traded emails w/ Valerie - she asked for screenshots for a presentation to exec team tomorrow morning at 6 am (!). &nbsp;Sent screenshots, said she doesn&#39;t need anything else, will let me know how it goes tomorrow.<br />
<br />
4/8 - Traded emails with VAlerie on pricing options, she&#39;ll discuss internally to determine seats.<br />
<br />
3/28 - demo w/ team<br />
<br />
3/27 - pushed demo to 3/28. &nbsp;Shared Ethnos info w/ Scott. &nbsp;They are targeting 3 full-access users and between 5 and 10 read-only users. &nbsp;3/28 demo will include Gary (president) and Cameron (role TBD, based in Dallas).<br />
<br />
3/25 - traded emails with Valerie Noel, tentatively scheduled demo for 3/27, 10 am CDT.<br />
<br />
3/17 - tt Scott - likely won&#39;t be able to set up a demo until next week (week of 24th). &nbsp;In the meantime, I need to check on our Outlook plugin - Scott&#39;s IT guys want to take a look at that or learn a bit more detail about it. &nbsp;Sent pricing overview via email.<br />
<br />
2/28 - Demo w/ Scott, Ruby, and Valerie. &nbsp;Ruby&#39;s focus is on sending Contracts to subs. She had to leave early, but I showed ability to build lists of subcontractors by discipline/company type, export to Excel, and how that could be used for Mail Merge into Word contracts. &nbsp;<br />
Scott and Valerie really liked system, particularly proposal generation.<br />
Up next: &nbsp;demo for firm principals (Tom &amp; Suzannne?). &nbsp;Important to them: using Cosential as internal storage for resumes and projects long term; Lead Tracking; possibly mobile. &nbsp;I can gloss over the Proposal stuff with the principals. &nbsp;Jed and Scott to coordinate demo times via email.<br />
<br />
<br />
2/25 - lvm Scott re: demo scheduling.<br />
<br />
2/21 - emailed Scott re: demo times next week?<br />
<br />
2/19- Had intro call with Scott, Ruby (handles subs/bids), and Valerie (handles proposals). &nbsp;Using Act 2010 CRM, which does not work with their new Office 2010. They do extensive work through a terminal server, soliciting bids (I think) from large groups of subcontractors, many of them pre-qualified. In ACT, they have those groups sorted by trade (e.g., drywall, HVAC). &nbsp;They&#39;ll attach project specs/drawings to an email and blast it out to everyone a list. They want to be able to do that in Cosential, or something similar. Valerie interested in proposal automation &amp; estimating (she does not have an estimating platform... uses InDesign). Ruby handles &quot;hundreds of contracts per month&quot;, normally using a standardized form, and is accustomed to mail merges in Word (I think)... if we could help with that, great. &nbsp;<br />
Also looked at SugarCRM and ACT 16 - neither appears to do what they want. &nbsp;Timeframe: asap. &nbsp;These three folks are evaluation team, tey will make a recommendation, then we&#39;ll get the money folks involved (Alberto &amp; Suzanne, if I understand correctly). &nbsp;<br />
Scott emailing me a couple of options for demo times next week, I&#39;d like to include Matt or Dan or Reid on that demo.&nbsp;</p>

Talked pricing detail - $5200 could be difficult, firm principal (John) would have to approve spend. They have little data, she is hoping we can be flexible on implementation cost.&nbsp;Sent overview info, she'll recommend Cosential to John, hopefully the three of us can get on a demo. Timeframe: &nbsp;ASAP. &nbsp;Hope to make decision this quarter. &nbsp;MArketing department is Heather, plus some assistance from 2 support staff. &nbsp;Heather does biz dev, as does firm principal (John).&nbsp;</p><p>---OUT FOR DEMO WITH JED---2/7/14- Heather responded to my email...ready to go.<br><br><br>Their marketing dept. was formalized last month.

<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>7/29 - call w/ Cathy (see activity), addressed concerns on implementation and simultaneous implementation w/ Ajera. &nbsp;Cathy said signature Monday, we&#39;re pushing for EOM - expiration of contract which includes concessions.<br />
<br />
7/23- lvm - confirming docs got there okay monday, any questions?<br />
<br />
7/21 - Cathy called back to discuss seats, Matt pushed anniversary date and got her to stick with 10 seats. &nbsp;Jed re-sent agreement with new anniversary date, along with implementation overview, should have signature early next week.<br />
<br />
7/17 - updated dollars to $10,520 &nbsp;- (matt ran contract for me while I was out - new quote 12-0453B)<br />
<br />
7/14 - lvm, let me know a good time to reach you today<br />
<br />
7/11 - called, no msg<br />
<br />
7/10 - lvm Cathy, will try her in morning.<br />
<br />
7/09 - great demo, they&#39;ll discuss internally (but I think we&#39;ll get the expanded group). &nbsp;8 folks on demo: &nbsp;Cathy (finance), Cara (CAR-uh), Mindy, and Bonnie (all three Marketing), Denny Sutherland &amp; Bill Stinson (dedicated sales roles), Fred Green (president &amp; Head of sales), and Dennis McGuire (some sales responsibility). &nbsp; Talked to Cathy in advance of demo, reviewed the docs she sent me, contract terms (we&#39;ll be doing this on Cosential paper but honoring Axium&#39;s implementation quote), strategy.<br />
<br />
7/08 - tt Cathy, rescheduled demo for tomorrow. &nbsp;She gave me rundown on attendees - this call is basically to determine how many seats. &nbsp;Let her know contract will be on Cosential paper. &nbsp;She is sending me info to prep for demo. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
7/07 - Cathy Erwin, Director of Finance, has postponed meeting today - two DMs have a conflict, not worth doing if we can&#39;t have them on the call - we&#39;re seeking their approval to sign off on this ASAP. &nbsp;Should have reschedule info today, per Cathy.</p>

<p>6/24- Scheduled demo w/ Cripe team (8 people will be on the call) for Friday, July 7th. &nbsp;With Sean Gotter @ Axium. &nbsp;Want to buy, planning to purchase that week (or within a few days of demo), need to have a few additional folks see system in action to sign off, also need to determine number of licenses. &nbsp;<br />

<div>So, remember in 2008 when you and I talked and talked to the KBE BD Group (formerly the Konover Group and our former contact was Marie Maia) about their weekly hot opps report (SOW attached)? &nbsp;Their president wanted a link to the Weekly Hot Opps report emailed to him (they actually really wanted a PDF of the report emailed to them) and this was their must-have thing? &nbsp;So, they never said yes to SOW, Marie left and they stopped using us for Business Development (not sure when this happened) but Jonelle had mentioned to them we have all sorts of new stuff so now Cora Harkins of their BD Group called me today and wants sales rep to call her re: using Cosential again for BD. &nbsp;Cora Harkins phone: 860.284.7622 email:&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:charkins@kbebuilding.com"">charkins@kbebuilding.com</a></div>

<br />
2) When a project manager changes a project description or training or education info, the workflow engine can alert marketing or HR that a change was made. &nbsp;Will it just say a change was made or will it show what change was made such as highlighting? &nbsp;And before the change takes affect, can it be approved by HR and or Marketing?

	Michael,</p>
<p class=""p4"">
	This is great timing as I am very interested in learning more about how a program like this could&nbsp;help us manage our client database. I really want to see how it works and what kind of capabilities it offers. I just recently mentioned this to our&nbsp;President to see if it was something I could look into and he was on-board with me doing some research. I am quite busy over the next&nbsp;couple of weeks, but I might have some time next week. Let me know if you have time then.</p>

We expect to narrow our search to final candidates the following week and make a final selection by Feb 1, 2012 and immediately enter into final negotiations.
