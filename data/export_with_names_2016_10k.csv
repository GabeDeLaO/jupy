<p>Hello!</p>

<p>My team is interested in learning more about Cosential.&nbsp; We have attended a few of the free webinars about the product over the last month.&nbsp; We are particularly interested in learning more about the implementation services and the cost of implementation.&nbsp; We are looking to move forward quickly as we have already looked into other CRM programs and feel this one best suits our needs.&nbsp; Please let me know when someone is available.</p>

&nbsp;<br />
Project &amp; Requirements Overview<br />
Applications needed:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sales Automation<br />
Key features needed:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This buyer wants a system that will track contacts with owners, architect,s and engineers, set followups, track appointments, and affiliate projects with contacts. User friendliness is important to this buyer. In depth reporting isn&#39;t necessarily a selling point here.<br />
Deployment:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Not Determined<br />
Currently using:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Spreadsheets and binders.<br />
Reasons for shopping:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Keeping track of contacts and followups is very difficult to do.<br />
Who they&#39;ve evaluated:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing yet.<br />
Price expectations:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Screened for $65/user/month plus setup.<br />
Timeframe:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Within a few months. They&#39;re in the very early stages.<br />

Follow-up instructions:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#39;t call today or tomorrow (1/21-22). She&#39;ll be upset if you do because she has a family member in the hospital and she&#39;ll be waiting on calls regarding that in her spare time. Call around 4:00pm-5:00pm CST on Monday or Tuesday (1/25-26).<br />
Contact notes:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Karen will ultimately be the final decision maker with input from other key executives.<br />
