<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We currently use Procore as our construction mgt software and have used Insightly in the past, but to limited results.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re considering salesforce simply because I used in the past.&nbsp; Do you have a demo package or software download to evaluate?&nbsp; Or maybe a quick demo at our office?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Track and nurture future projects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once it turns into a sale, show the potential of the opp.</p>

Number of Users:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;51 to 100 users. They expect that they&#39;ll need it for marketing, administration, and project managers, so that comes to close to 100 people. They may make some decisions to narrow it to fewer though.<br />

Project &amp; Requirements Overview<br />
Applications needed:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sales Automation<br />
Key features needed:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This buyer wants a system that will track clients more effectively. They need to track interactions and followups, keep client notes, track their project pipeline, and coordinate communication. They don&#39;t need lead management features.<br />

Price expectations:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Screened for $75/user/month plus setup in the five figures.<br />

<p class=""p10""><span class=""s1"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=""p10""><span class=""s1"">I was doing some research on CRM systems and when researching Cosential came across a few questions:</span></p>

<p class=""p10""><span class=""s1"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=""p10""><span class=""s1"">What are the IT requirements to purchase Cosential for employees?</span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">None. Cosential is a cloud app.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=""p11"">&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""p10""><span class=""s1"">What are the user requirements? Does each employee need a profile or can we share one profile across a department?</span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You can have one profile for multiple employees, but you will loose a great deal of functionality. We also have a three user minimum.</span></p>

<p class=""p11"">&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""p10""><span class=""s1"">If we choose to stop using Cosential after a given amount of time, do we lose our data, or can we have it backed up?</span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We will send your data back as a MS SQL 2008 database via FTP. You can also export your data using the reporting engine &nbsp;to Excel.</span></p>

<p class=""p11"">&nbsp;</p>

Holding off on CRM for now until ERP locked down. &nbsp;Moving Opp to Nurture - nothing happening here in near term, and unlikely to ever happen if we do not have 2-way integration capability w/ Ajera.<br>2-way sync is #1 thing for them. &nbsp;Willing to re-engage on Cosential if and when we can do 2-way w/ Ajera, assuming they keep it. &nbsp;The Cosential API is probably not the route they want to go... I get the impression they lack the technical expertise and/or bandwidth in-house to take a DIY approach to 2-way sync.<br><br>5/29 -&nbsp;NOTE: per Ajera Chat on their website, Ajera API is closed, not open, but they are working on an open version. &nbsp;(5/29/15)<br><br>5/29 -&nbsp;Good demo w/ Bill, Bob, and John - our ability/inability to sync w/ Ajera, 2-way, be be deciding factor. They want to look over API specs. &nbsp;Bill out next week, we'll talk week of June 8th. &nbsp;Currently using Ajera on-premise. &nbsp;Bill and Bob do BD/sales work, John does not, he is most knowledgeable guy about Ajera, not sure what his title is. &nbsp;Really focused on BD functions - tracking interaction, scheduling tasks/calls, syncing w/ outlook, visibility, reminders, contact list sort. &nbsp;Almost always sub-contractor, liked Teamed Opportunities in Cosential. Want to sync info from Cosential into Ajera to minimize duplicate entry. &nbsp;Currently have all project info and pre-project info (when they begin billing time against something) in Ajera, all lead info in a separate Access db that Bill and John use. &nbsp; Not particularly interested in proposals, we didn't look at it, they do mostly fee proposals. Their Outlook uses Exchange 2013. &nbsp;Uncertain whether they want to maintain Ajera as acctg/PM software - Ajera is unveiling &nbsp;a new PO module on the 17th of June, how well that works for them may be deciding factor on whether they stick with Ajera. &nbsp;2-way integration is their biggest concern - if they do stick with Ajera, then the Ajera CRM module may be most likely solution. &nbsp;They like Cosential, realize they wouldn't use all features/functions, but could grow into it... &nbsp;if they can create a push from Cosential to Ajera through our API, that would give us a huge boost. &nbsp;Sent API info to John.<br><br>5/28 - emails w/ Bill - rescheduled demo for 9 am CDT tomorrow. &nbsp; Bob Fuller and John Mihalic will join us.<br><br>5/26-&nbsp;tt Bill, scheduling difficulty, pushing demo back to later today<br><br>5/22 - set demo for tuesday, 5/26<br><br>5/21 - LVM Bill<br><br>5/04 - Jed email - demo scheduling? &nbsp;emails w/ Bill, he is out of office at moment and booked next week, please call him subsequent week.

R-O. &nbsp;Currently have a custom application for proposals, it has some estimating/calculation components. &nbsp;Cosential can't do estimating, but they may be able to have Dynamics SL do that and sync it into Cosential, or have their estimating application sync into Cosential through our API. &nbsp;Will want references eventually. &nbsp;Time frame TBD: &nbsp;first demo for Brent, then we'll demo to leadership at Mulvaney &amp; Banani. &nbsp;Firm has partners, 3 likely to be involved in decision process, one of whom is the CEO (Mick? Nick?) who will be key decision-maker. &nbsp;Although the firm isn't terribly tech-savvy today, they are investing heavily in tech, sounds like CEO is driving a lot of that. &nbsp;Sent GoToMeeting for Thursday w/ Brent. &nbsp;Emailed Brent API documentation. &nbsp;<br><br>4/06 - emailed w/ Brent, confirmed call 10 am tomorrow<br><br>4/1 - emailed Brent<br><br>Event Type: demo<br>Company: Direct Tec Inc.<br>FullName: Brrent Goheen<br>Email: brentgoheen@directtec.ca<br>Phone: 4039215394<br>FormURL: http://www.cosential.com/demo/</p>","442154,664068",,"John Hazlett,Andy Hughes",,,,,,,,,

<p>Hi Daniel (Viewpoint),</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know we just started our VPC project, but this came up today.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re currently using a product called NorthBoundary for Service Sales tracking, proposals, CRM, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you have anything that does this independent of the full Vista package?</p>

Environmental &amp; Transportation, Cultural &amp; Environmental. &nbsp;Lots of responses to gov&#39;t RFPs. Migrating to cloud version of Ajera now, almost complete. Currently using Access for project database, Indesign for proposals. &nbsp;Lots of SF330s and 255s. 75% sub, 25% prime. Interested primarily in proposal automation. As we talked, some of pipeline mgmt stuff could benefit them as well: &nbsp;weekly marketing reports (pursuit status), opportunity analytics, ability to tell (when they&#39;re a member of multiple bid teams going after same project) which pieces of info/resumes have been submitted to which primes. Ken is VP, wears multiple hats - IT, projects, marketing. Early in process - Ken needs to see it first, then he&#39;ll have to get a few others involved to sign off on spend, sounds like there is not a formal budgeting/approval process in place. &nbsp;Reviewed pricing (approx. $4200 implementation w/ Ajera). &nbsp;Streamlining collaboration/visibility between the 2 offices important. &nbsp;Lots of growth in last year or two (by 20-ish people, opened NYC office), have more diverse people/projects. Lack of ability to store detailed project descriptions in Ajera is frustrating them. &nbsp;Does not want a contact management solution - this is proposals (resumes, cut sheets, gov&#39;t forms) + pipeline. &nbsp;Tentatively scheduled demo for 9 am CST on Wednesday, 1/21, he will check with his marketing folks (whom he&#39;d like to include on demo) and email me to confirm.&nbsp; &nbsp;--- &nbsp; 1/14 - lvm &amp; emailed<br /><br />Event Type: demo<br />Company: FHI<br />FullName: Ken Livingston<br />Email: klivingston@fhiplan.com<br />Phone: 8602477200<br />FormURL: http://www.cosential.com/demo/</p>","651940,651940,721442,721442",,"Cody Rademacher,Cody Rademacher,Oscar Reyna,Oscar Reyna","FDC: Financial Data Connector,FDC: Financial Data Connector,FDC: Financial Data Connector,FDC: Financial Data Connector",Architecture/Engineering (A/E),"Accounting : Axium Ajera,Marketing : In-house Access DB,Accounting : Axium Ajera,Marketing : In-house Access DB","Marketing Management,Marketing Management,Marketing Management,Marketing Management",,,31-100,"No        ",

			<br />
			10/02 - demo. &nbsp;Brent narrowing the field to a limited # of vendors, 2nd demo to follow w/ broader group once that has happened.<br />
			&nbsp;
			<p>10/01 - had exploratory call w/ Brent, scheduled demo for 10/02 at 9:30 am CDT. &nbsp;Likely January rollout, 6-10 users. &nbsp;Ajera, $4200-ish for implementation.</p>

<p>8/25 - Judy called in on sales line, Dan qualified, I called her back to schedule demo. &nbsp;Judi is Director of Marketing and Business Development. &nbsp;Firm has two salespeople. &nbsp;May want 3 full seats, 3-4 R-O. &nbsp;Talked pricing. &nbsp;Implementation ballpark $3k, standard, plus $2500 for Viewpoint integration. &nbsp;Sounds like data migration needs are minimal, so we may be able to do a little bit less on implementation. &nbsp;Talked through implementation process/timeline. &nbsp;Mostly hard bid proposals, but some big Quals/proposals. &nbsp;Scheduled demo for tomorrow. &nbsp;</p>",442154,,John Hazlett,CONTACTS: Outlook,Construction,Accounting : Vista by Viewpoint,CRM,,,101-300,"No        ",

Please call Mike on Friday if I haven't heard from them by then. &nbsp;Mike generated some enthusiasm for Cosential with his counterparts - we may have a chance to introduce this to sister companies Structall and FabSouth at some point in the future. &nbsp;</p><p>8/25- traded emails w/ Mike, he pushed our call to next week - he's traveling today.</p><p>8/18 - Good demo. &nbsp;Mike thinks it looks like a great fit. &nbsp;He is also a fan of Viewpoint, has used it in past companies, likes that we can integrate with them. &nbsp;Too soon to know what they will do on accounting/ERP, but that will become clearer in coming weeks. &nbsp;He is meeting next week with counterparts at parent entity (Canam Group) - will find out to what degree their systems will be independent, waiting on that insight before moving this along. &nbsp;Sent him quote for small rollout (min. seats) with caveat that the implementation component would be higher if they are going to import significant data from other sources (i.e., Canam group contacts or personnel). &nbsp;Follow up Monday or Tuesday of next to get updates/plan next steps. &nbsp; Initially, Mike will be using Lotus Notes (as Caman does) instead of Outlook, although he'll have Outlook on his computer. &nbsp;Would like to know if any degree of Lotus integration possible, even if it is ""forward Lotus contacts and emails to Outlook automatically, then sync from Outlook"". &nbsp;</p><p>8/15 - talked w/ Mike. &nbsp;New division (independent) of larger company (Canam Group). &nbsp;Only 2 people. &nbsp;Wants CRM - minimize duplicate entry, avoid info getting lost, be able to track what is due when. &nbsp;Some proposal automation needs initially (quals). &nbsp;$5k+ first year. &nbsp;No specific budget or timeline. &nbsp;Scheduled demo for Monday. &nbsp;Mike is BD &amp; marketing, other person in Central Steel Erectors is Operations. &nbsp;Wants to grow quickly, scalable solution important.<br><br><br>Event Type: demo<br>Company: Central Steel Erectors<br>FullName: Mike Jantz<br>Email: michael.jantz@centralsteelerectors.com<br>Phone: 240-357-8041<br>FormURL: http://www.cosential.com/demo/</p>","442154,442154",,"John Hazlett,John Hazlett","CONTACTS: Outlook,CONTACTS: Outlook",Construction,"CRM : Outlook,CRM : Outlook","CRM,Business Development",,,1-30,"No        ",

Brent emailed today - hasn&#39;t been able to reach him - I tried today, no luck. &nbsp;Will stick with it.<br />
<br />
7/30 - lvm DelShaun<br />
7/29 - DelShaun OOO today, will be back tomorrow - emailed and lvm for Jerry Slater (who was on May demo).<br />
<br />
7/28 - unable to reach Delshaun, Brent reports no feedback from Delshaun. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
7/24 - Update from DelShaun - late this afternoon, emailed that he is meeting with president before COB tomorrow, will provide update as soon as he has that meeting. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
7/22 - no reply from Brent, vm nm for DelShaun<br />
<br />
7/17- Brent update: &nbsp;convo w/ president hasn&#39;t happened yet, he is contacting DelShaun today to feel out enterprise.<br />
<br />
7/11 - strategy session w/ Brent: &nbsp;his meeting w/ principal pushed to next week, but he reiterated that the only hurdle to overcome is comfort w/ Deltek acquisition, and he sees no difficulty. &nbsp;He agrees Enterprise is a good bet for them - they could have up to 20 users, but Delshaun wants to start small, so we can hopefully drive up the dollars w/ Enterprise. &nbsp;Brent is going to feel it out on a call today, if it looks like a good bet I&#39;ll talk with Delshaun and put together a quote. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
7/09 - vm Brent Jones - want to discuss w/ him whether DelShaun is candidate for Enterprise... &nbsp;this firm is planning a small number of seats initially, want to add later, but we may be able to make it a larger deal with enterprise initially, want to get Brent&#39;s perspective on this - if proposing that would slow this down, not worth it.<br />
<br />
7/08 - final hurdle - firm principal needs to have convo w/ Axium to resolve lingering concerns over Deltek acquisition (likely wants assurances that Ajera product will be continued to be supported). &nbsp;Brent Jones has that call scheduled for Friday, 7/11. &nbsp;Delshaun will have authority to sign after that, assuming principal is reassured.<br />
<br />
6/09 - they&#39;re taking a step back, thanks to Deltek acquisition. &nbsp;DelShaun concerned about support for Ajera and FDC going forward. &nbsp;Proposed that we have a call w/ DelShaun to address, talk through from Cosential&#39;s end (we&#39;ll support same way as SEMA4 and Win2). &nbsp;Working on scheduling.<br />
<br />
5/27 - per Brent, decision in mid-June. &nbsp;Talked strategy on how to push investment in all licenses (20-ish, final # TBD) rather than just a few initially (land-and-expand, what Delshaun is leaning toward now). &nbsp;Brent will keep me posted, actual quote will go to Delshaun next week after Brent&#39;s scheduled call with him.<br />
<br />
5/23 - Meeting w/ Michelle Kurtz, Erin Westergard, and DelShan. &nbsp;On our end: &nbsp;me, Matt, Brent, and Ron (Axium). &nbsp;Focused on accounting, forecasting, and integration with Ajera and Cosential. &nbsp;They are impressed with Cosential, DelShaun asked Brent to get him a quote early week of 5/27 once he finalized # of users. &nbsp;Brent was pushing them to upgrade to Ajera 8 in order to get Cosential, Matt encouraged them to get Cosential implementation underway ASAP. &nbsp;Michelle asked Brent to wait on Ajera 8 - that will be a separate issue, likely to tackle in June (when Michelle can get an Ajera consultant on-site). &nbsp;Overall, very positive - should get a Cosential agreement in place relatively soon (I&#39;d estimate early June, chance to pull into May).<br />
<br />
5/15 - 90 minute demo with Brent Jones (Axium) and multiple Slater Hanifan people: &nbsp;DelShaun (Marketing Coordinator), Sherry Edelman (Bus. Dev. Liaison; proposals &amp; resumes along with DelShaun), Michelle Kurtz (Director Finance &amp; Administration), Erin Westergard (asst. Controller, has only been at firm a few weeks), and Jerry Slater (principal?). &nbsp; Very detailed questions on specifics, not terribly sophisticated on CRM - have just started tracking information on spreadsheets. &nbsp;Got bogged down considerably in the minutia of Cosental-Ajera integration... &nbsp;Michelle in particular had a very different focus than the other folks on the call - interested in revenue forecasting, processes, permissioning, all related to financials. &nbsp;May need to reconvene with her for a separate discussion. &nbsp;Sending registration link for Proposal webinar to Brent to pass along to DelShaun and Sherry (spelling of her name?). &nbsp;Provided lots of suggestions for processes/workflows - they&#39;re trying to figure a lot of that out. &nbsp;<br />

<p>Jed, yes great meeting you.&nbsp; Yeah that was a little cumbersome doing the commute back and forth, especially in the monsoons we had.&nbsp; I did get my Marriott rewards points though.&nbsp; I enjoyed the conference, definitely some great info.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I talked with my marketing person, Jenny Chubb and my boss, Jim Posda. &nbsp;Right now CRM is not a priority, so they would rather not start dialogue at the time.&nbsp; They said if you can send any brochures, links, or materials describing your services to me, I can put it in our resource file.&nbsp; Right now those two are just buried and just don&rsquo;t want to dive in to this stuff right now. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope you understand.&nbsp; I will certainly be an advocate of you and your services when the timing aligns with our priorities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<br />
2/26 - Demo with David &amp; Ed. &nbsp;Moved through CRM relatively quickly, focused more on proposal automation. &nbsp;Ed asked about all of the other links - surveys, goals, marketing, website, etc. &nbsp;They think this would be worth putting in front of their principals, but they&#39;re concerned that principals could never be persuaded to use a CRM system. &nbsp;Ed to send me info on things to highlight for principals: &nbsp;Likely reporting &amp; survey tool. &nbsp;Need to get more insight into Marketing/email functionality to share with David on a future call.<br />

2/24- rescheduled Wednesday demo time for 3 pm CST/4 EST.<br />

2/20 - exploratory call with David &amp; Ed Darr (CFO). David started at 3North in July. &nbsp;Wants to consolidate lead tracking and marketing initiatives - need consistent &amp; effective way to track info. Most business comes from word of mouth, some from public RFP sites (they do not win the bulk of those projects). Their SF office is one person (they&#39;d like to grow it), and their TX office is essentially just a physical space to hold client conferences. Do not have project info consolidated in Ajera, it is only on their server. &nbsp;David really only person doing Marketing (and the info he needs is scattered far and wide, could benefit from proposal automation), partners doing biz dev. Just starting CRM evaluation/search. &nbsp;Use inDesign. &nbsp;Scheduled demo for 2/26 at 10 am CST.</p>

Bill will run initial evaluation solo, once he has two options, final decision will be made by&nbsp;a select group of partners (up to 7). &nbsp;Bill joined firm one year ago as Biz Dev, is now a partner with Biz Dev focus.

<p><strong>interview with Tom Neary &nbsp;Q. When you think about the future of the business development/marketing of professional services - do you foresee any changes in the way the job is done? Or trends for the future?&nbsp;</strong><br />
A: It seems to me that the future keeps showing up at the front door. The pace of change with regard to technology, access to information, and the increasingly global marketplace all contribute to some of the most exciting times ever in our industry, despite the recent years of a down market. The biggest challenge for everyone going forward is similar to what many of us already face today - keeping up with all the information flowing into our respective lives each day, and filtering through it effectively enough to do our jobs well.</p>","105363,109509",,"Reid Kegel,Scott - Active to check activities Naiva",,,,,,,,"No        ",

I have a demo scheduled with her 12/13/10 at 930am, onsite.  Their<br>office is about 20 minutes from my house.  I''m also talking to her about<br>volunteering for SMPS Florida (she is past president and currently on the<br>board).  Also, their firm is looking to hire Carol Doscher (client of ours<br>and keynote speaker at our User Conference) in January of next year.   So,<br>I''ll take this lead for now and give to you if I can (believe me, I wish I<br>could hand over to you now!).<br>Oh heck, I''ll make this the call log.  They had demo a few years ago with<br>Dan and although interested, they didn''t feel like we were quite at the<br>point that it worked for them.<br>Demo Note:  Dan gave her demo few years back and although she liked<br>product/Dan she did mention that she got the impression that Dan is very<br>involved on development side and that it was like having her engineer<br>husband explain something to her (quickly and with jargon).  She noted that<br>she felt like I understood her pain points.<br>Web site update:  She was impressed with web site update and felt that it<br>demonstrated our expanded capabilities and did a much better job of quickly<br>and clearly demonstrating value analysis.  She said all I want to know when<br>I get to site is ""How does this make my life easier?"" and that our current<br>site did a better job of conveying.<br>Interested in Ethnos connection especially. They have nothing now.  No ideas<br>what system financial data system they use.  Asked that I send her<br>implementation questionnaire so she could be prepared.<br>Best,<br>Christina<br>On Mon, Dec 6, 2010 at 12:26 PM, Reid Kegel  wrote:<br>> Hey Christina,<br>><br>> Was wondering if you ever had lunch with Alexandra from Kaufman Lynn?
