<p>Brief call with Andy to qualify and demo is set for 4/12.</p>

<p>Notes - Hello Jeff,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We currently use Procore as our construction mgt software and have used Insightly in the past, but to limited results.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re considering salesforce simply because I used in the past.&nbsp; Do you have a demo package or software download to evaluate?&nbsp; Or maybe a quick demo at our office?</p>

<p>Central repository.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dashboard to see individual metrics and company metrics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Track and nurture future projects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once it turns into a sale, show the potential of the opp.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking at an ERP system to then push that info into PM or accounting software.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Need a dashboard, but that is not too exciting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Owner and all management will be using it, we are all selling.&nbsp; We all get our hands dirty and sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Number of Users:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;51 to 100 users. They expect that they&#39;ll need it for marketing, administration, and project managers, so that comes to close to 100 people. They may make some decisions to narrow it to fewer though.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Project &amp; Requirements Overview<br />
Applications needed:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sales Automation<br />
Key features needed:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This buyer wants a system that will track clients more effectively. They need to track interactions and followups, keep client notes, track their project pipeline, and coordinate communication. They don&#39;t need lead management features.<br />

Price expectations:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Screened for $75/user/month plus setup in the five figures.<br />
